In Berlin, the rabbits run wild.
The rabbits were running wild to Berlin to go see the wettbewerbsfaehig Dirndl League match.
The league was sponsored by the ratskeller, with beers on sale for this annual event.
The losers of the competition were to be turned into bratwurst.
The hunds would then proceed to devour the losers till there is nothing left of them
In the end, the apfelkuchen is the only thing they remain.
The best hund that day drove off in its own Porsche
Along with this prize, the winner was also rewarded a Hauptstrasse
The hunds could drive along this hauptstrasse in their porsche while wearing lederhose.
After a long night of celebration, they went to a biergarten and got drunk.
On the night they got drunk, they built a schloss to keep all the apfelkuchen,
and made a mehlhase for them to dance with.
And as others marveled at the schloss they made, many compared it to that of Eltz and praised their work for years to come.
But of course, no castle is complete unless it is filled with apfelkuchen, so they made a it it's own Baeckerei to make more!
Any apfelkuchen that did not fit in the schloss were given to the baeckerei.
